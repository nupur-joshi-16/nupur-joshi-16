# 👋 Hi, I’m Nupur

🚀 **Project: restart-42**  
I’m on a mission to reinvent myself. After years in design, I’ve decided to start over — not just professionally, but personally. `restart-42` is my journey to grow, build discipline, and become a confident programmer from the ground up.

💻 **What I’m Working On**  
Currently focused on the “100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp” by Dr. Angela Yu.  
I'm learning one step at a time and documenting the process — wins, setbacks, and everything in between.

🐍 **Learning Focus**  
- Python (primary language)

📈 **Goals**  
- Build technical depth through consistent practice  
- Develop real-world projects  
- Earn with code and grow professionally
